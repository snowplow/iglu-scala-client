# Scala client for Iglu

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis]
[![Release][release-image]][releases]
[![License][license-image]][license]

A Scala client and resolver for **[Iglu schema repositories][iglu-wiki]** from the team at **[Snowplow Analytics][snowplow-website]**.

Iglu Scala Client is used extensively in **[Snowplow][snowplow-repo]** to validate self-describing JSONs. For a presentation on how we came to build Iglu, see **[this blog post][snowplow-schema-post]**.

## Installation

The latest version of Iglu Scala Client is 0.6.0, which currently works with Scala 2.11 and 2.12.

If you're using SBT, add the following lines to your build file:

```scala
val igluClient = "com.snowplowanalytics" %% "iglu-scala-client" % "0.6.0"
```

Note the double percent (`%%`) between the group and artifactId. That'll ensure you get the right package for your Scala version.

## API

Iglu Scala Client has "tagless final"-friendly API, allowing end-users to abstract over effects they use:

* `cats.effect.IO`, ZIO or similar lazy referentially-transparent implementation for most production use cases
* `cats.data.State` for testing purposes
* `Id` when you need an eager implementation

Generally, we highly recommend to use a referentially-transparent implementation,
but in some environments like Apache Spark or Apache Beam it is not possible to use lazy implementation.
In Spark and similar environments we recommend to use `Id`, but everything needs to be tested in real environment.

Primary entity for working with Iglu Scala Client is `com.snowplowanalytics.iglu.client.Client`.
It consists of two objects: `Resolver` and `Validator`. First one responsible for registry traversal, schema resolution, fetching and caching.
While second one just checks the datum against resolved schema and returns a report.

`Client` has only one method:

```
def check[F[_]: Monad: Clock: RegistryLookup](instance: SelfDescribingData[Json]): EitherT[F, ClientError, Unit]
```

This method performs resolution and validation steps altogether. Also you can use `Resolver` and `Validator` separately.

* `F[_]` is an effect type, usually representing a side-effect
* `Monad` is an implicit evidence that `F` has an instance of `cats.Monad` type class
* `Clock` is an implicit evidence that `F` has an instance of `cats.effect.Clock` capability and thus has an access to wallclock
* `RegistryLookup` is an implicit evidence that `F` can perform lookups. Its a tagless-final capability, defined for Iglu Client.
* `ClientError` is an error ADT, representing a failure happened either due resolution or validation step

`Client` companion object also has `parseDefault` method which allows you to instantiate `Client` instance from **[resolver configuration][resolver-config]**. It will also instantiate a mutable cache instance (thus, result is wrapped in `F[_]`).

## Example

Second working method is `lookupSchema`, receiving Schema key as String or directly `com.snowplowanalytics.iglu.SchemaKey` object,
this method traverse all configured repositories trying to find Schema by its key.

```scala
import io.circe.Json
import io.circe.literal._   // circe-literal is not bundled with Iglu Client

import cats.effect.IO
import cats.syntax.show._

import com.snowplowanalytics.iglu.client.Client
import com.snowplowanalytics.iglu.core.{SchemaKey, SchemaVer, SelfDescribingData}

implicit val clockIoInstance: Clock[IO] = Clock.create[IO] // Usually provided by IOApp

val resolverConfig: Json = json"""{
  "schema": "iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.iglu/resolver-config/jsonschema/1-0-1",
  "data": {
    "cacheSize": 5,
    "repositories": [{
      "name": "Iglu Central",
      "priority": 0,
      "vendorPrefixes": [ "com.snowplowanalytics" ],
      "connection": { "http": { "uri": "http://iglucentral.com" } }
    }]
  }
}"""

val instance = SelfDescribingData(
  SchemaKey("com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow", "geolocation_context", "jsonschema", SchemaVer.Full(1,1,0)),
  json"""{"latitude": 3, "longitude": 0}""")

val result = for {
  client <- Client.parseDefault[IO](resolverConfig).leftMap(_.show) // It can be a DecodingError
  _ <- client.check(instance).leftMap(_.show) // ClientError has an instance of Show type class
} yield ()
```

Above snippet will return a lazy side-effect that can be either a ClientError in case data is invalid against its schema
or there some kind of resolution problems, or simply nothing (`Unit`) in case of success
